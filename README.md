### DocumentoGPT: Your AI Assistant for Content Creation

- **Summarize Multimodal Content**: Easily upload documents, images, and audio files. Our tool provides concise summaries, making information consumption quicker and more efficient. Supported formats include .docx, .pdf, .pptx, images with text, and audio files.
- **Generate Documentation**: Transform complex topics or amalgamate multiple documents into a single, coherent, and user-friendly document. From executive memos to technical guides and presentations, we streamline documentation.
- **Break Language Barriers**: Translate documents and audio files across various formats, facilitating seamless communication in multiple languages.
- **Extract Key Insights**: Analyze documents to surface essential insights and specific details like names, dates, and places, simplifying information retrieval.
- **Interactive Document Engagement**: Navigate complex documents through a chat-like interface, asking questions and receiving answers based on the document's content.
- **Custom Document Creation**: Produce personalized documents from scratch or templates, catering to diverse needs such as reports, proposals, or research papers.

### SketchGPT: Harnessing Multi-Agent Architecture for Creative Exploration

- **Visualize Your Ideas**: Describe your vision, and Sketch GPT will bring it to life. From dreamy landscapes to detailed designs, your imagination sets the boundaries.

SketchGPT is a multi-agent system using the Autogen framework on the backend, where a critic and a designer work together to automate the prompt generation process based on user-provided evaluations to generate high-quality images.


## üõ†Ô∏è How Can I Use the App? 

To deploy your Streamlit application locally, follow these steps:

1. **Create a Conda Environment**: First, you need to create a Conda environment using the `environment.yaml` file provided in the repository. Open your terminal and run:

   ```bash
   conda env create -f environment.yaml
   ```
To activate your Conda environment and run your Streamlit application, follow these steps:

2. **Activate Conda Environment**: After creating your environment, activate it using the command:
   ```bash
   conda activate <your_env_name>
   ```

3. **Launch the Application**: To start your Streamlit app, navigate to the `src/app` directory in your terminal and execute:

    ```bash
    streamlit run src/app/Home.py
    ```
