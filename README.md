### DocumentoGPT

DocumentGPT utilizes Azure AI Document Intelligence and AOAI services, including GPT-4o and Whisper models, to automate document summarization, translation, and generation, aiming to improve efficiency in content management and accessibility.

What can you do with DocumentoGPT ?

- **Summarize Multimodal Content**: Easily upload documents, images, and audio files. Our tool provides concise summaries, making information consumption quicker and more efficient. Supported formats include .docx, .pdf, .pptx, images with text, and audio files.
- **Generate Documentation**: Transform complex topics or amalgamate multiple documents into a single, coherent, and user-friendly document. From executive memos to technical guides and presentations, we streamline documentation.
- **Break Language Barriers**: Translate documents and audio files across various formats, facilitating seamless communication in multiple languages.
- **Extract Key Insights**: Analyze documents to surface essential insights and specific details like names, dates, and places, simplifying information retrieval.
- **Interactive Document Engagement**: Navigate complex documents through a chat-like interface, asking questions and receiving answers based on the document's content.
- **Custom Document Creation**: Produce personalized documents from scratch or templates, catering to diverse needs such as reports, proposals, or research papers.

### SketchGPT

SketchGPT is a multi-agent system utilizing the Autogen framework on the backend. It employs DALL¬∑E 3 as the artist agent for generating images and GPT-4o as the evaluator or critic agent. This collaboration automates the prompt generation process, leveraging user-provided evaluations to produce high-quality images.

What can you do with SketchGPT ?

- **Visualize Your Ideas**: Describe your vision, and Sketch GPT will bring it to life. From dreamy landscapes to detailed designs, your imagination sets the boundaries.
